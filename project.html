        <h1>Environmental Issue: Deforestation By:Javier Guzman</h1>
        <p>Exploring Causes, Effects, and Solutions to the global issue 
        of deforestation</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="section-1" class="sub-section">
        <h2>I. Introduction: What is deforestation?</h2>
        <p>
          Deforestation is the deliberate, accidental, or natural removal of 
          trees and forests, it is usually for human use. It is one of the biggest threats
          to the environment, climate, and wildlife.
        </p>
   </div>

      <div id="section-2" class="sub-section">
      <h2>Causes and contributing factors</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Mining</li>
    you have to take away trees to clear a large area to be able to  mine, 
   australia has a mining place 
  <p>
    <li>Resources</li>
       Resources is a big contributing factor to the issue of Deforestation
       because we use a lot of paper, like in bags or even to write in school or in general,
       it is a big part of our every day item that we use.
  </p>
<p>
    <li>Burning</li>
   we burn trees to get fire and places that have a lot of natural forest fires,
   fires is also common in forested areas like the,United states,Canada,
   Australia,Western cape of south africa,Southern europe 
</p>  
  </ul>

        <h2>III. Effects on the Environment and Society</h2>
        <p>Less greenery </p> 
    <p>
        With less greenery there will be more air pollutions, because the trees pull in CO2 
        and if we cut them down it will cause an increase in air pollution and other gasses 
        to be in the air damaging our environment 
    </p>
     <p>
         Forest fires is an effect that causes this issue: 
         forest fires cause there to be more heat and so that certain area of land or 
         country will be heated up way more
         Less Resources: we use trees for paper so we cut down a lot of trees to be able 
         to make lots of paper and with that also comes less trees and soon we will be 
         reaching the end point of our natural resources
     </p>

  <h2>Potential solutions for the issue:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Planting trees</li>
      Reforestation and afforestation are key strategies to restore ecological 
      balance. You can participate in tree-planting initiatives or fund programs. 
<p>
  <li>Sustainable land use</li>
    Promoting sustainable agricultural and forestry practices can help 
    reduce deforestation.
  </p>
<p>
  <li>Responsible consumption</li>
    You can help by making responsible purchasing choices, such as buying less, 
    eating sustainable food, and choosing recycled or certified wood products.

        community to help me out with this.
